# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-using-Regression-Analysis
## Overview: 
    The rate of pricing of a house is dependent on numerous factors, ranging from physical to non physical. In this dataset we will do an analysis using some factors which we have put together in a small dataset for regression purposes such as age of house,closeness to convenience store and bus station and time of transaction...these will help to bring an understanding to these factors and other factors which might be closer to these ones also in other analysis
    Machine learning would be of use here mainly linear regression for now...
